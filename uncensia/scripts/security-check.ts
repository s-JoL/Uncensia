/**
 * Exercises the brute-force tarpit and the cross-site write rejection against a
 * running instance.
 *
 * The peer here is loopback and no proxy is declared, which is exactly the case
 * that no longer hard-locks: every request on earth looks the same from behind a
 * tunnel, so a lock on that counter would be a lever an attacker pulls to lock
 * the owner out. What is left is the pause curve, and this is what proves it is
 * still there — and still lets the owner in afterwards.
 *
 * This leaves a slow counter behind for the cooldown, so it is not part of the
 * e2e suite; run it on its own when touching auth. The tarpit is most of the
 * runtime — ten failures are about half a minute of deliberate pauses.
