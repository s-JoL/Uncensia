/**
 * Human approval for destructive coding calls.
 *
 * The model used to authorise itself by passing `confirm: true`, which is not a
 * safety property: the same reasoning that decided to delete the directory also
 * decided the delete was fine. Two pieces replace it. `describeRisk` classifies
 * a call from its validated arguments, and `ApprovalRegistry` parks the agent
 * loop until a person answers.
 *
 * Classification reads structure — which tool, which path, whether the target
 * exists — and never the meaning of a string. Whatever the model wrote is data
 * to be shown, not evidence to be interpreted.
 *
 * The durable half is the `approvals` table, written before anyone is asked and
 * the only thing a decision touches, so a refresh, a reconnect or a second
 * browser all see the same state and a double-tap decides once. This module is
 * the volatile half and is deliberately thin, because everything it holds dies
 * with the process while the row does not.
 *
 * One rule the code enforces rather than documents: a wait never resolves
 * itself as approved. Both the timeout and the run-cancelled path settle the
 * row as refused, so a question nobody answered can only ever fail closed.
