/**
 * How a provider presents its credential.
 *
 * `Authorization: Bearer <key>` is what almost every OpenAI-compatible endpoint
 * wants and stays the default, so an existing provider row behaves exactly as
 * it did. It is not universal: relay stations and Azure-shaped gateways read a
 * custom header (`x-api-key`, `api-key`), and a self-hosted Ollama, llama.cpp
 * or vLLM wants no credential at all. The style is therefore data on the
 * provider record, not a branch keyed on a vendor name or a hostname.
 *
 * The style rides on the provider row as JSON, so it is whatever was written
 * into `providers.auth` rather than something this code can trust: it is read
 * defensively and anything unrecognised resolves to `bearer`.
