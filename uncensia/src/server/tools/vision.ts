/**
 * Loads one picture into the conversation.
 *
 * History carries images as `[image image_id=…]` lines rather than pixels, so
 * looking is something the model does when it decides the answer depends on
 * what is in the frame. That is the whole point: Uncensia has no way to know from
 * the wording of a turn which picture matters, and the model does.
 *
 * The result is not persisted as an image, so a second turn that needs the same
 * picture asks again. Paying per look is what keeps a hundred-turn conversation
 * from carrying a hundred images it stopped caring about.
