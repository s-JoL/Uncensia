/**
 * How relevant a hit is relative to the best one this query found.
 *
 * There used to be a floor here — chunks under 0.3 cosine similarity were
 * dropped — but it only ever applied to semantic hits, because a keyword hit
 * has no similarity and was scored 1.0 by default. So the two halves of a
 * hybrid search were held to opposite standards, and a query whose best answer
 * happened to sit at 0.28 was told the library contained nothing.
 *
 * Ranking is the server's job; deciding whether the top-ranked passage actually
 * answers the question is the model's, and it is better equipped for it, having
 * read both the question and the passage.
